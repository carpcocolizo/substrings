## About time, it took me a couple of hours to figured out
## Ruby is so helpful, the built-in methods are great 
## Once you found the method you need you have just to think how to use it
## It was a 2 step problem
## The first step is how to isolate all the substrings of a giving string
## And the last step is how to compare against an array
## Is not the smoothest code, but is not hard to read
